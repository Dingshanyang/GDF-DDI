# GDF-DDI
#Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction Based on Graph Contrastive Learning and Dual-View Fusion.
This is our Pytorch implementation for the paper:


## Introduction


## Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.8.16. The required packages are as follows:
- torch == 2.0.1
- numpy == 1.24.4
- sklearn == 1.2.2

## Usage
The hyper-parameter search range and optimal settings have been clearly stated in the codes (see the parser function in main.py).
* Train and Test
